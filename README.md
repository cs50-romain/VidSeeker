# VidSeeker

# What is VidSeeker?
Vidseeker is a CLI tool that allows you to search for videos from the youtube api. I created this because I was tired of looking for each youtuber's latest video or looking for a random video to watch.

# Features
* Look for a random video from a chosen youtuber
* Add/Remove youtubers from your favorites list 
* Look for the most recent video of each favorited youtubers
* Look for most recent video of a chosen youtuber
* Probably something else that I forgot about while typing this list

# Getting Started
I'm still figuring this one out. I would need to create a bash file to create a local database. And then the go.mod should actually be enough for the Video and db packages. Or maybe I leave instructions here on how to setup the database:)

I might actually make this a website so to be seen for now.

# Prerequisites
A computer. And a terminal:)
